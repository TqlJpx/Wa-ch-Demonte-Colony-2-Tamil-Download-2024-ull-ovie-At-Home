Demonte Colony 2 delves deeper into the sinister mysteries surrounding the infamous Demonte Colony, picking up years after the events of the first film. The story intertwines multiple timelines and characters, weaving a complex narrative of interconnected fates and vengeful spirits.

The film begins with the mysterious death of Samuel "Sam" Richard, a cancer survivor, and his friends in 2009. Sam's wife, Debbie, suspects foul play and years later, encounters a series of eerie events that lead her to believe that Sam's spirit is trapped and seeking help.

Meanwhile, in Hyderabad, Raghu and his half-sister Aishwarya are locked in a legal battle with their estranged twin brother, Srini, over their father's vast estate. Srini, who survived a near-fatal accident in 2015, is now in a vegetative state, and Raghu seeks a court order for passive euthanasia, unaware of the cosmic connection that binds him to his twin.

Debbie's quest to communicate with Sam's spirit leads her to a Daoshi, who reveals the intertwined fates of Raghu and Srini and the sinister force that haunts Demonte Colony. Their destinies are linked to a mysterious book, "Unsung King of a Fallen Kingdom," and a chain that carries a deadly curse.

As Debbie, Raghu, and Dhayalan (Raghu's uncle) try to unravel the mysteries and protect Srini, they encounter a series of terrifying events, including ghostly apparitions, possessions, and a sinister ritual orchestrated by the vengeful spirit of John Demonte.

The film culminates in a thrilling climax where the characters confront the evil forces and attempt to break the curse that binds them to Demonte Colony.
